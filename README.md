# FitPy

#This is a program I am writing and creating as I learn more and more about Python.
#The hopes is to watch this program evolve from something simple to a more complex and robust program

############### STAGE ONE ##################################
#The program is at it's simplest form. It should take in a users name, age, heigh, weight, activity level, and goals
#Based on the information that the user inputs, it should output their TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and a sample meal plan
